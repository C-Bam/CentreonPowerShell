# Description

CentreonPowerShell module is designed to wrap the centreon Command Line API (CLAPI) into PowerShell Syntax.

The general idea is to benefit from PowerShell's strength and ease of use, and also to help people that know better Microsoft's scripting than Bash, Python or Perl.

The recent release of PowerShell Core 6.0 on Linux systems allows to use PowerShell now, and even though it still lacks some features, it gets the job done.
